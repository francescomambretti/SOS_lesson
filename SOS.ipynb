    "### Meet the $PATH\n",
    "- Now, let us suppose that you are inside a folder such as <font face = \"Courier\"> `~/Documents/my_folder`</font>. The content of the folder is a single file called <font face = \"Courier\"> `my_file.cpp`</font>, which is a source code written in <font face = \"Courier\"> C++</font> which contains some instructions to be executed. You compile with <font face = \"Courier\"> `g++ my_file.cpp -o my_file.x`</font> and everything works, even if nothing called \"<font face = \"Courier\"> g++ </font>\" is present in the current folder. Why does it work? \n",
    "It works because your OS knows a list of paths inside your computer in which to look for executables if they are not present in the current directory. That is, somewhere on your machine there exist a file called \"<font face = \"Courier\">g++</font>\" which is exactly the <font face = \"Courier\"> C++ </font> compiler we need.\n",
    "- If you run <font face = \"Courier\"> `which g++`</font> on your shell, it will give you back something like: <font face = \"Courier\"> `/usr/bin/g++`</font> which is the absolute path of the executable <font face = \"Courier\"> g++</font>. \n",
    "- All the pre-defined paths are contained in the environment variable <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH</font>, whose actual value can be obtained by typing <font face = \"Courier\"> `echo $PATH`</font>.

    "- Let us move to your \\$HOME (via <font face = \"Courier\"> `cd` </font> or <font face = \"Courier\"> `cd $HOME` </font> or <font face = \"Courier\"> `cd ~` </font>). By typing <font face = \"Courier\"> `ls -a` </font>, a list of files and folders will be displayed, included several whose name begins with \".\", the so-called hidden files. A particularly relevant hidden file is <font face = \"Courier\"> .bashrc </font> (or, sometimes, <font face = \"Courier\"> .bash_profile </font>). <font face = \"Courier\">.bashrc </font> is a configuration file whose instructions are loaded each time you open a new shell. Look, for example, <a href=\"http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html\"> here</a>  for a more detailed explanation (things are slightly easier for macOS users...)\n",
    "- This file can be modified (we'll later see why and how to do it). To make these changes effective, one can open a new shell tab or type <font face = \"Courier\">`source .bashrc`</font> from the <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$HOME</font> directory.\n",
    "- Typical contents of such a configuration bash script are the **alias** and the **export** commands (but they are not the only one, for example take a look <a href=\"https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-shell-change-the-color-of-my-shell-prompt-under-linux-or-unix/\">here</a> to permanently make your shell colourful and pretty-looking).\n",
    "- An alias is a way to state that, by default, typing <font face = \"Courier\"> `command1` </font> and <font face = \"Courier\"> `command2` </font> in a shell produces the same results. The syntax <font face = \"Courier\"> `alias command1='command2'` </font> makes it possible (no blank spaces befor and after the <font face = \"Courier\"> `=`</font>!). For example, I can write <font face = \"Courier\"> `alias ll='ls -l'` </font>  or  <font face = \"Courier\"> `alias tolab='ssh -XY name.surname@tolab.fisica.unimi.it'`</font>. This is very comfortable and can make absolutely easier your daily life as programmers... \n",
    "Now, you can define an alias whose validity is limited to the current terminal session or you can make it default. To do this, simply add a line to <font face = \"Courier\"> `source .bashrc`</font> with the same command you would give interactively on the shell and make the change effctive.\n",
    "- The typical thing you want to export, instead, is a path, e.g. <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH </font> (but also some variables with numerical values can be exported).\n",
    "The <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH </font> variable stores a list of folders which are read in order and, if a correspondence is found, the search through the list is stopped. Therefore, adding a specific path to <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH</font> extablishes the priority of an executable found in that position with respect to any other executable with the same name but found elsewhere. In order to add a path to the head of <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH </font> you must type <font face = \"Courier\"> `export \"my/new/path:$PATH\"`</font>; if you instead want to add a low-priority path to <font face = \"Courier\"> \\$PATH </font>, just type <font face = \"Courier\"> `export \"$PATH:my/new/path\"` </font>\n",
    "For example, it will be useful - in order to use Intel Python overpassing the default Python executables present in <font face = \"Courier\"> /usr/local/bin </font> - to permanently add to the configuration file <font face = \"Courier\"> `export /opt/intel/intelpython3/bin:$PATH\"`</font>."

In case one needs to kill a given process, e.g. the number 22186, the command is: <font face = \"Courier\">`pkill 22186 `</font>. The command <font face = \"Courier\">pkill</font> can also be used with the flag <font face = \"Courier\">-u username</font>, where you have to replace <font face = \"Courier\">username</font> with a valid user account name. In this case, you will kill **all** the running processes of a user (including the interactive shell). If <font face = \"Courier\">username = $USER</font>, you will kill all your own jobs.
